# ABAP Visual Blueprints

A minimal, black-and-white Next.js prototype that visualizes ABAP program flow using blueprint-style nodes.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the canvas.

## Overview

The canvas highlights core ABAP statements like `START-OF-SELECTION`, `SELECT`, `LOOP AT`, and `WRITE` as connected nodes, favoring clarity over color or chrome.
